This project was built using Vue, CSS and basic JavaScript.
I created a home page and a repo details page where my repositories were pulled from Git Hub with the details on the details page.
I also linked my GitHub to the repo details page if I need to check my codes.
I have an about me page which covers everything about me.
This project was challenging and fun at the same time.
